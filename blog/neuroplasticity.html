  <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>

  <div class="body">

  <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

  <p class="round1">How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit you? Neuroplasticity allows your brain to adapt and change more easily. It can help promote the ability to learn new things and also strengthen existing neuro pathways. Understanding this can help improve your brain fitness, allowing you to learn and retain information more easily and more efficiently.</p>

  <p class="round1">After researching neuroplasticity a little, I can see the clear and obvious benefits to understanding it and being mindful of it while learning. Our course material requires a lot of reading and staying focused on the task which inherently results in improving neuroplasticity. I believe being mindful of this will benefit me even more so. I also plan to engage with neuroplasticity more through regular exercise, even its just some morning yoga, and getting plenty of sleep.</p>

  <p class="round1">Some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity are by stimulating the brain with activities such as reading, art and other creative pursuits, learning how to play an instrument or learning a new language. I believe this can be further improved by getting plenty of rest and doing regular exercise.

  During my research I found <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886">this website</a> very helpful, check it out!

  <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

  <p class="round1">What is a growth mindset and why is it relevant? A growth mindset is the opposite of a fixed mindset. It is the idea that you can be constantly looking to grow. Including looking at challenges as an opportunity to learn, and to look at failure as a positive springboard into helping you succeed the next time round. It is relevant to our work because to keep in that mindset whilst facing challenges in these studies is to improve our ability to learn. As there is so much information to learn and so many obstacles to overcome in this type of study, a growth mindset can only be viewed as a positive.</p>

  <p class="round1">"studies on different kinds of praise have shown that telling children they are smart encourages a fixed mindset, whereas praising hard work and effort cultivates a growth mindset. When students have a growth mindset, they take on challenges and learn from them, therefore increasing their abilities and achievement." - src: <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Carol Dweck</a> I find it amazing how two different types of praise, despite both being positive, can result in such a different outcome. This is important especially when thinking of the long term development of students or anyone learning something new. To think praise for being smart could have a detrimental effect, where as simply praising their hard work could have a hugely positive effect, carrying on to the rest of their learning experiences.</p>

  <p class="round1">I plan to take it onboard and remind myself of it, especially when I get stuck on a problem. To think of challenges and problems as a chance to learn and grow will make it easier on myself mentally and in practice.
  <br>
  I believe my research on neuroplasticity further backs up my plans to try to sleep better, and do some morning yoga. Combining this with keeping a positive growth mindset seems like a sure way to improve my ability to learn greatly. Im excited to take on some challenges now and to look at them as a positive opportunity to learn and grow, rather than something thats holding me back in that moment.
