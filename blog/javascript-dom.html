    <h3 >An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>

    <p class="round1">An analogy I would use to describe the differences between HTML and CSS would be to look at them as parts of the process of building a house. HTML would define the foundations, framework, windows/doors, how big the rooms are and where they're located. CSS on the other hand would define the style, shapes and colours schemes throught the house - the colour of the exterior, roof, carpet, walls, furniture etc. Also, where in the house any furniture, plants or features etc might be placed and how big they are. 
    <br>
    In terms of a webpage, HTML is used to define the structure of a webpage and the text content within it, and CSS is used to add colours, design and style to the webpage. 
   <br>
   HTML and CSS each play their part in a finished webpage and Javascript is no different. Javascript is what allows you to add complex features to a webpage such as interactive buttons, animations and much, much more. </p>

    <h3>Control flow and loops</h3>
    
    <p class="round1">Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Loops are used by the script to make decisions based on wether the specified criteria has been met. They use conditional statements such as 'if...'' and 'Else, if...' and looping statements such as 'while...' and 'do... while...'.
    <br>
     An example of an everyday process for a looping statement could be like crossing the street at some traffic lights, e.g.
    <br>if (walking signal is red) {
    <br>    Stop walking
    <br>} else if (cars are coming) {
    <br>    Stop walking
    <br>} else if (cyclists are coming) {
    <br>    Stop walking
    <br>} else {
    <br>    Continue walking
    <br>}
    <br>The script will work its way down answering each statement with either 'True' or 'False'. If the conditions in the statement are true, the script will loop around and start again until the conditions are false, in which case the script will move on to the next statement and decide if that is true or false, and so on.</p>

    <h3>What is the DOM, and how might you interact with it?</h3>
    
    <p class="round1">The 'DOM', short for Document Object Model is a programming interface that can be used to change the structure, style and content of a webpage. The DOM represents these elements as nodes and objects, so programming languages, such as javascript, can connect to the page and manipulate it. The DOM acts as a bridge between an HTML webpage and Javascript, allowing the script to communicate with the web browser to access the content of the HTML document.
    <br>
    To see the DOM in your own browser, you can right click on the webpage (At least with Chrome and Edge) and click 'Inspect'. This will bring up the interface. From here you can see the webpage in its HTML document form. Amongst all of the amazing (and somewhat overwhelming) features, you can click on a little mouse-pointer button at the top which allows you to hover your mouse over parts of webpage and see information about that element. Clicking that element will take the DOM to that section of the HTML document. This can be very useful for developers for finding out how something on a webpage has been done or for even for bug fixing. Another feature is being able to edit the HTML document's text to display whatever you like on the webpage - Though this is only editing your local page and once you refresh the page, it will change back to normal.
    </p>

    <h3>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
    
    <p class="round1">Objects represent 'things' in your code that can be assigned properties and characteristics. Data from 'objects' can be accessed using both 'dot' and 'bracket notation' methods.
    <br>
    Arrays are list-like objects in which you can store data. Data from arrays can be accessed using zero-based indexing, which means the first item in the list will be 0 (the 0th), the second will be 1, third will be 2 etc etc... 
    </p>

    <h3>What are functions and why they are useful?</h3>
    
    <p class="round1">A function is a piece of code that is designed to perform a particular task. It can be executed by 'calling' or 'invoking' it. Functions are very useful in Javascript as they allow you to automate a process, such as evaluate another piece of code and return the data that from it that you had asked for, to use again. This allows you to put a task together and make it a function, to save you from having to write in the same code time and time again for different inputs.</p>
