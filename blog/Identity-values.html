<h1>Identity & Values</h1> 
 <div class="body"> 
  <h2> Identity </h2>
   <p class="round1">Lately I've had more time to think about my own personal growth. For the last 10+ years I've worked as an Electrician, mainly doing servicing and maintenance work on the residential side of things. This has led me to encounter people from all walks of life, as I work in their homes and personal spaces. As such, I've learned and grown a lot, but the time has come to take a big step and make a change towards the lifestyle I would like to live. I chose EDA after a friend (A previous graduate) spoke so highly of them. I also really liked the idea of EDA's unique learning environment, and realised we share many of the same values. I feel this is a step in the right direction in terms of my future and Im so stoked to be here.
    
  <h2>Personal values</h2>
   <p class="round1">The core personal values I hold high are respect, kindness, empathy, loyalty and acceptance. 
   <br>
   Some feedback from close friends and famiy: Good listener, caring, dedicated once I put my mind to things, logical, sensitive, patient, laid back/easy going, a good sense of humour, passionate, sometimes lacking confidendce, generous, good manners, not being judgemental, being a rock to my friends, loyal and honest... 
   <br>
   After some time spent reflecting on this, I believe the main influences to have made me who I am are my parents. Although they separated when I was at a young age, they maintained a lot respect for each other and raised me with two significant values in particular - Kindness, especially from my mother, the most caring and kind person I've ever met. And respect, especially from my father. I believe many of my other personal values can be related back to the kindness and respect that they taught me.
   <br>
   Another big influence for the way I am today is due to the area I grew up in. The sea-side suburb of New Brighton, Christchurch, and its neighbouring suburbs is a tight-knit little community with a lot of aroha to give. There are many people from all across the socio-economic spectrum, with a great range of cultural diversity. This was very much the same during my time at school - My first few years at a catholic school and later moving to a more general school. Through out all of this time I've found myself somewhere in the middle, which ultimately has led me to becoming very empathetic.
   </p>
  <h2>An ethical decision...</h2>
   <p class="round1"> An example of an ethical decision I've had to make would be when I was much younger. I was walking down the street with a friend in New Brighton and there was a man coming towards us, head down and focusing on whatever was in his hand. As we passed him we noticed a trail of cash had been falling out his pocket for the last few seconds. Hundreds of dollars were on the ground and without hesitation I called out to him and started picking it up before it could blow away. Why? We could have taken all that money and been rich! The thoughts involved in weighing up that decision were simple - If that were me, I'd hope someone else would do the same! The consequences of that decision were a very grateful stranger who rewarded us with a $20 note out of that money... 
   <br>
   Funnily enough, and I have only just realised this all now, but, a few years back I had taken $300 out of an ATM while in a rush and stupidly left the cash hanging out of the machine. The person waiting behind me had seen this and called out to me to make sure I got my money which I was extremely grateful for...
   <br>
   Coincidentally, this man was also a part the New Brighton community, (The ATM situation happened on the opposite side of town) and I still see him around to this day. Maybe it was good karma from my decision as a kid. I like to think so.
   </p>

  <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
   <p class="round1">
   My strengths in learning are a mixture of kinesthetic and a little bit of intrapersonal. I retain information better when putting it into practice as I can see first hand how they whole process comes together, especially if im doing it on my own so as not to let my attention wander off. That way, I remember it in my own way.
   <br>
   A testimony to this is in my last career as an electrician. We spent a year in class completing the course but when I eventually got an apprenticeship, I learned more in the first few months than I did the entire year in class. 
   <br>
   Even more so, when I eventually went out in my own van to run jobs, I feel I learned more in the first year than I did in the couple years of being an apprentice.
   <br>
   My other strengths would be my attention to detail, my ability to communicate and work well with a team, as they were also crucial parts of my work as an electrician. I believe these strengths will help in my learning journey due to the nature of the course being so hands on and also being balanced between interpersonal and intrapersonal.
   <br>
   My limitations are that I can be easily distracted and I can sometimes focus too much on finer details.
   </p>

   <h2>Resistance or tension in the workplace...</h2>
    <p class="round1">
     During my time as an electrician I was in charge of running a very big and remote job with only one apprentice to help.  This job was an hour and half drive each way daily for several months and so we were doing 11-14 hour days. The apprentice was in his final year of training and so was highly skilled and knowledgeable, and after years of working together we had become quite good friends.
     <br>
     As we grew more tired and took more pressure from our bosses to get the job done faster, tensions grew between us as we had disagreements on which was the best way to do a task, as he tended to take shortcuts, and I had a high standard of workmanship (which was sometimes my downfall as aforementioned above regarding attention to detail being a limitation). It became very stressful for me as I was doing all the driving, ordering of gear and the communication with the owners, my bosses and the other trades on site.
     <br>
     The strategies I used to deal with the situations was that if the apprentice was adamant about his idea, I would go along with it so long as the end results were up to my standard. I figured this would also be a good learning experience for him. Sometimes things went well, sometimes not so well. My other strategy was giving him constructive critcisim on how he should bring up his idea, by being humble and sincere instead of his normal approach which was quite desecrating. 
     <br>
     Overall it resulted in less tension between us, as I learned to let go and he realised being the decision maker wasn't as easy as he first thought. I can't think of any better way to handle the situation right now as it all worked out quite well. We no longer work together but we're still good mates and I think ultimately, that job brought us together more than anything.
