<div class="body">
 <h3>What is emotional intelligence?</h3>

 <p class="round1">EQ, short for Emotional Quotient, is a measure of someone's emotional intelligence. It is defined by an individuals ability to identify, evaluate, control and express emotions in themselves and others in a positive way.</p>

 <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>

 <p class="round1">IQ, short for Intelligence Quotient, is a measure of an individuals ability to apply logical reasoning, mathematics, word comprehension and to learn and understand. IQ is measured with a standardised type of test designed to assess one's intelligence for which they're given an 'IQ score'. To put it simply, IQ is a measure of intellectual intelligence and EQ is a measure of emotional intelligence.</p>

 <h3>Why is it important?</h3>

 <p class="round1">EQ is important as it helps in an individual's ability to understand, empathise and connect with other people. Research shows that a higher EQ is associated with a wide range of benefits including improved mental health, stronger relationships with friends or loved ones, higher job satisfaction and academic performance, right down to everyday situations where you are meeting and interacting with new people. </p>
