    <h1>Foundations Reflections</h1>

    <h2>Some reflections on my time spent during foundations part of our bootcamp.
    </h2>

    <div class="body">
        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        </h3>

        <p class="round1">
            I've learned that a lot of my self doubt comes from comparing myself to others. Not that I worry if others
            as better than me or not but more so in the sense that they're so much further ahead in their programming
            knowledge, and I wonder if I'll be able to keep up during bootcamp
            <br>
            I really enjoy working with people. It's been a huge transition for me to go from working full time with
            other people to studying full time by myself, and im looking forward to getting stuck into the bootcamp with
            other students and being able to bounce ideas of each other and discuss the work to help me better
            understand things.
            <br>
            I've realised I do learn so much better and are able to focus more easily when I've had a good nights sleep.
            I can be guilty of staying up late trying to make the most of my evenings and after looking into
            neuroplasticity and reflecting on how I feel when I haven't slept well, I am beginning to understand how
            hugely important it is to get enough sleep.</ul>
        </p>

        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

        <p class="round1">
            In learning and programming, these skills are important in helping you to work with others to the best of
            your's and your peers' ability. They help you to be understanding, kind and proficient at working and
            learning together in a team. With a growth mindset and these skills at hand, both learning abd programming
            abilities could benefit exponentially compared to the lack of.
        </p>

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h3>

        <p class="round1">
            The benefits of both neuroplasticity and growth mindset. I hadn't heard of either of them before starting
            foundations and what surprised me was the research to prove exactly hwo advantageous they can be when
            understood and put into practice correctly
        </p>

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h3>

        <p class="round1">
            I found trying to put my self doubts and bad habits such as procrastination and staying up late aside to be
            the hardest part and it is something I continue to work on. I also found exploring my personal values
            difficult as although I understand them internally, I've never really had to explore them externally and
            reflect on them via writing.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
            development bootcamp course. </h3>

        <p class="round1">
            I think EDA understands exactly how important core learning is and the amount of time spent on it during
            this course is proof of that.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
            that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

        <p class="round1">
            No, it has taught me a lot about myself and about others. There will be plenty of time to practice
            programming in the future, but learning about EQ, neuroplasticity, growth mindset, values and self awareness
            is something that will only make that practice easier.
