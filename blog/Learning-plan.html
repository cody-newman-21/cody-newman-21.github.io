  <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

  <h2>Formulating what it will take for me to be learning to the best of my ability...</h2>

    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

    <p class="round1">To get to a point where I can find the ultimate work/lifestyle balance. To be able to work remotely and choose my own hours of work, while working on projects that are meaningful and can make a positive impact in peoples lives.</p>
  
    
    <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning?</h3>
    <p class="round1">
    Im good with communication and being patient in learning new things. I also find it easiest to learn when I can be more hands-on and apply the skills to real situations, so these first two weeks have been a great deep dive learning experience. 
    <br>
    My limitations are that I don’t learn too well by sitting and listening as my attention can start to wander. I also find I can go down the rabbit-hole on particular things quite easily and end up falling behind.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
    <p class="round1">
    My confidence in myself. The ability to deal with pressure without getting overwhelmed, stressed or anxious. To be punctual, responsible and dependable.
    </p>
    
    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme </h3>
    <p class="round1">
    I plan to get into the routine of getting up early and treating the day and workload as if it were a real job. This will mean not staying up too late and getting enough sleep so that I’m ready to wake up and get into it in the morning.
    
    If I find myself getting too stressed out, I will remind myself to remain calm, focus on my breathing and go take a break. I've noticed if I take a break and go for some fresh air, a walk, or even just a quick stretch - I can come back to the work feeling much more clear headed and ready to take on the problem more systematically. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <p class="round1">
    I will speak up sooner if I’m really stuck and reach out to my fellow students and facilitators through the slack channel.
    </p>
    
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
    <p class="round1">
    I'd expect them to be supportive and understanding, and from what I've seen so far, they are. I had a really great tutor during my  last course (Small business management/project management) who was able to adapt to every individual students needs and make sure nobody got left behind. I’d like to be able to get a quick response to a question, even a quick video call to be able to discuss things easier. But I understand that everyone is busy and so I won't rely on that.
    </p>
