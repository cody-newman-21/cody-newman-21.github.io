    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

    <h2>Part 1: Formulating what it will take for me to be learning to the best of my ability...</h2>

    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

    <p class="round1">To get to a point where I can find the ultimate work/lifestyle balance. To be able to work
      remotely and choose my own hours of work, while working on projects that are meaningful and can make a positive
      impact in peoples lives.</p>


    <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning?</h3>
    <p class="round1">
      Im good with communication and being patient in learning new things. I also find it easiest to learn when I can be
      more hands-on and apply the skills to real situations, so these first two weeks have been a great deep dive
      learning experience.
      <br>
      My limitations are that I don’t learn too well by sitting and listening as my attention can start to wander. I
      also find I can go down the rabbit-hole on particular things quite easily and end up falling behind.
    </p>

    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
    <p class="round1">
      My confidence in myself. The ability to deal with pressure without getting overwhelmed, stressed or anxious. To be
      punctual, responsible and dependable.
    </p>

    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme </h3>
    <p class="round1">
      I plan to get into the routine of getting up early and treating the day and workload as if it were a real job.
      This will mean not staying up too late and getting enough sleep so that I’m ready to wake up and get into it in
      the morning.

      If I find myself getting too stressed out, I will remind myself to remain calm, focus on my breathing and go take
      a break. I've noticed if I take a break and go for some fresh air, a walk, or even just a quick stretch - I can
      come back to the work feeling much more clear headed and ready to take on the problem more systematically.
    </p>

    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <p class="round1">
      I will speak up sooner if I’m really stuck and reach out to my fellow students and facilitators through the slack
      channel.
    </p>

    <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
    <p class="round1">
      I'd expect them to be supportive and understanding, and from what I've seen so far, they are. I had a really great
      tutor during my last course (Small business management/project management) who was able to adapt to every
      individual students needs and make sure nobody got left behind. I’d like to be able to get a quick response to a
      question, even a quick video call to be able to discuss things easier. But I understand that everyone is busy and
      so I won't rely on that.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 2: End of foundations reflections and update to learning plan...</h2>

    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

    <p class="round1">
      My long term goal is very much still the same. I'd like to be able to have the ultimate work/lifestyle balance and
      be able to put my skills to use in a meaningful way to help better peoples lives, ideally while being able to work
      remotely. The skills I hope to gain from this course are basically a solid understanding of the programming
      languages we will be taught so I can futher improve and focus on them and better understand other languages after
      the bootcamp.
    </p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>

    <p class="round1">
      My strengths and limitations are very much the same, although I've realised two big things during foundations -
      that another strength of mine is being able to work in a team, as I recalled working with others in my previous
      job and how effective that was towards my learning and work output. On the other hand, I realised this through one
      of my limitations - That working and in particular learning by myself isn't as easy as I first thought. I tend to
      look into things too much and get stuck on the detail and without having someone to talk to and bounce ideas off
      or guide me, I get overwhelmed and lost. From what I've heard about the structure of bootcamp I think ultimately
      these things will help me.
    </p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>

    <p class="round1">
      I think my biggest non-technical challenges will be staying focused and putting my time to good use, as well as
      making sure I get enough sleep to be learning at my best, by not staying up too late and getting distracted. I
      plan to really make an effort as it is something I need to work on, not just for the bootcamp but for going
      forwards in life after the bootcamp too.</p>

    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>

    <p class="round1">
      As stated above in my strengths and limitations, I would like to work on my ability to stay focused and to get a
      good nights sleep each night. I realise how important both of them are and that staying focused is heavily based
      in getting a good nights sleep. Other than this, I would also like to improve on my ability to communicate while
      under pressure and speak up when im unsure.
    </p>

    <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>

    <p class="round1">I would hope that they're understanding of each students individual needs and abilities. I worry
      that I may not be able to keep up but I dont want to be left behind, although I realise this is mostly up to me
      and the effort I put in. I would also expect that the team do their best to explain concepts so as not to leave
      the students with holes of important information left out. In this regard I think context is highly important.</p>

    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>

    <p class="round1">
      My expectations are that I will get out what I put in. When I need to, I will try to seek help through my peers,
      tutors or through google. I understand the next 9 weeks could be very intense at times so I will try not to be too
      hard on myself and I'll try to make sure im enjoying myself too.</p>

    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h3>

    <p class="round1">I intend to get to sleep before midnight and be up at 8am to make sure I get at least 8 hours of
      sleep each night. I will eat well and exercise regularly to make sure my body and mind are performing at their
      best for learning and working with others. If I get stressed out or overwhelmed outside of course hours I will
      take a break to rest my mind. I would like to start reading before bed as I understand the benefits of this, but will
      explore this more once I've gotten started with the bootcamp.</p>
