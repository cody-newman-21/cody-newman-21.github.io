  <h1>Identity & Values</h1> 
  <div class="body">
  <h2> Identity </h2>

  <p class="round1">In terms of identity, lately I've had more time to think about my own personal growth. For the last 10+ years I've worked as an Electrician, mainly doing servicing and maintenance work on the residential side of things. This has led me to encounter people from all walks of life, as I work in their homes and personal spaces. As such, I've learned and grown a lot, but the time has come to take a big step and make a change towards the lifestyle I would like to live. I chose EDA after a friend (A previous graduate) spoke so highly of them. I also really liked the idea of EDA's unique learning environment, and realised we share many of the same values. I feel this is a step in the right direction in terms of my future and im so stoked to be here (and no longer crawling through dusty, itchy and tight roof spaces (: )

  <h2>Personal values</h2>
